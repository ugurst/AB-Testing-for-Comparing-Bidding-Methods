# A/B Testing

This project includes an A/B testing application designed to compare the performance of Facebook's 'maximum bidding' and 'average bidding' bid types. The main objective is to analyze the difference in conversion rates between these two bidding methods and determine which method is more effective.

Business Problem
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding method, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing 'maximum bidding'.

One of our clients, ---.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to understand whether average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding.

The A/B test has been ongoing for a month, and now bombabomba.com expects you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success metric for ---.com is Purchase. Therefore, the Purchase metric should be the focus for statistical tests.

This dataset, containing a company's website information, includes data such as the number of ads seen and clicked by users, as well as the earnings generated from these. There are two separate datasets: a Control group and a Test group. These datasets are located on different pages of the ab_testing.xlsx Excel file. Maximum Bidding is applied to the Control group, and Average Bidding to the Test group.
